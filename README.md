This is an assignment for my IB Computer Science project (hi Mr.Walker). I'm just documenting things I did on Github.

Description

1. Anna-MilanPull.gif
  The gif shows a combination of the pull request I approved and the one I requested. Milan D. had submitted a pull request on my web scraper. He imported the Click library to help with specifying how many times to run the program as well as correcting errors I had on my code. His addition to my code fixed the error. The code works and I have approved it. 
As for my part, I added Twilio to my code. This lets it send a message to my phone every time the code runs. The code works and I merged it to my respository.


2. Anna-GabePull.gif
    The gif shows my pull request I created on Gabriela P.'s respository. I have also added Twilio to her web scraper code.  This lets it send a message to my phone every time the code runs. The code works. However, she has not accepted my pull request yet (she said her computer is broken).
    
    
3. Anna-AnneMariePull.gif
    The gif shows my pull request I created on Annemarie P.'s respository. I have added a flowchart that was missing. The pull request has been approved and merged.
